Ciro Chiappini is Senior Lecturer in Nanomaterials and Biointerfaces at King’s College London. His research combines nanotechnology, bioengineering and cell biology to develop nanomaterials for advanced therapies and spatial biology. He has developed new approaches for topical gene therapy to the eye and skin for the treatment of inherited diseases; advanced regenerative medicine for periodontal disease; and developed new approaches for longitudinal sampling in spatial biology . His research has been funded by the ERC Starting Grant, UKRI, CureEB  and Fight for Sight. In 2021 Dr. Chiappini was recognised as emerging biomaterial scientist by the Royal Society of Chemistry.  He was Marie Curie Fellow and Newton International Fellow at Imperial College London from 2011 until 2016, and holds a doctorate from the University of Texas at Austin. Dr. Chiappini authored more than 50 publications with over 7000 citations and 4 international patents.
